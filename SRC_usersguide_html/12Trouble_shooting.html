In this chapter hints are given for solving some difficulties that
have occurred frequently. This chapter is by no means complete and the
authors would appreciate further suggestions which might be useful for
other users. Beside the printed version of the users guide, an online
pdf version is available using <TT><B>help_lapw</B></TT>.  You can search
for a specific keyword (use <IMG

<P>
If an error occurs in one of the SCF programs, a file program.error is
created and an error message is printed into these files.  The
<TT><B>run_lapw</B></TT> script checks for these files and will automatically
stop if a non-empty error file occurs.

<P>
Check the files <TT><B>case.dayfile</B></TT> (which is written by
<TT><B>init_lapw</B></TT> and <TT><B>run_lapw</B></TT>), <TT><B>:log</B></TT> (where a history
of all commands using <TT><B>x</B></TT> is given) and <TT><B>*.error</B></TT> for
possible explanations.

<P>
In several places the dimensions are checked. The programs print 
a descriptive error message and stop.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>case.outputnn:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file gives error messages if the atomic
  spheres overlap. But it should also be used to check the distances
  between the atoms and the coordination number (same distance). If
  inconsistencies exists, your <TT><B>case.struct</B></TT> file may contain
  an error.  A check for overlapping spheres is also included in
  <TT><B>mixer</B></TT> and <TT><B>lapw1</B></TT>.

<P>

<DT><STRONG>case.outputd:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Possible stops or warnings are: 

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>``NO SYMMETRY OPERATION FOUND IN ROTDEF``:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This indicates that
  in your <TT><B>case.struct</B></TT> file either the positions of equivalent
  atoms are not specified correctly (only positive coordinates
  allowed!!) or the symmetry operations are wrong. 

<P>
</DD>

    iteration.  Later, (usually in the second to sixth iteration) it
    may indicate that in your SCF cycle something went wrong and you
    are using a crazy potential. Usually it means that mixing was too
    big and large charge fluctuations occured.  Check previous charges
    for being physically reasonable (grep for labels :NTOxx :CTOxx
    :DIS). You will probably have to delete <TT><B>case.broy*</B></TT> and
    <TT><B>case.scf</B></TT>, rerun <TT><B>x dstart</B></TT> and reduce the mixing
    parameter in <TT><B>case.inm</B></TT>. In very difficult (magnetic) cases a
    PRATT mixing with 0.01 mixing might be necessary at the
    beginning!

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>``STOP RDC_22``:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This indicates that the overlap matrix is
    not positive definite.  This usually happens if your
    <TT><B>case.struct</B></TT> file has some error in the structure or if
    you have an (almost) linear dependent basis, which can happen for
    large RKMAX values and/or if you are using very different
    (extremely small and large) sphere radii <IMG

 ALT="$R_{MT}$">.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>``X EIGENVALUES BELOW THE ENERGY emin``:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This indicates that
    X eigenvalues were  found below emin. Emin is set in  <TT><B>case.in1</B></TT> 
(see sec.
    <A HREF="7SCF_cycle.html#sec:lapw1-in">7.3.3</A>) or in <TT><B>case.klist</B></TT> generated by KGEN,
    see <A HREF="6Initialization.html#sec:symmetry">6.3</A>, <A HREF="6Initialization.html#sec:kgen">6.5</A>). It may indicate that your
    value of emin is too high or the possibility of ghostbands, but it
    can also be intentional to truncate some of the low lying
    eigenvalues.

<P>
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>If you don't find enough eigenvalues (e.g.: in a cell with 4
    oxygens you expect 4 oxygen s bands at roughly -1 Ry) check the
    energy window (given at the end of the first k-point in
    <TT><B>case.in1</B></TT> or in <TT><B>case.klist</B></TT>) and make sure your
    energy parameters are found by subroutine SELECT or set them by
    hand at a reasonable value.

<DT><STRONG>case.output2:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Possible stops or warnings are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>``CANNOT BE FOUND``:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This warning, which could produce a
    very long output file, indicates that some reciprocal K-vector
    would be requested (through the k-vector list of lapw1), but was
    not present in the list of the K generated in lapw2. You may have
    to increase the NWAV, and/or KMAXx parameters in lapw2 or increase
    GMAX in <TT><B>case.in2</B></TT>. The problems could also arise from wrong
    symmetry operations or a wrong structure in <TT><B>case.struct</B></TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>``QTL-B VALUE``:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If larger than a few percent, this
    indicates the appearance of ghost bands, which are discussed below in
    section <A HREF="#sec:ghostbands">12.1</A>.
<BR>
The few percent message (e.g up to
    10 %) does not indicate a ghost band, but can happen e.g. in
    narrow d-bands, where the linearization reaches its limits. In
    these cases one can add a local orbital to improve the flexibility
    of the basis set.  (Put one energy near the top and the other near
    the bottom of the valence band, see section <A HREF="7SCF_cycle.html#sec:lapw1-in">7.3.3</A>).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>FERMI LEVEL not converged</STRONG></DT>
<DD>(or similar messages). This can
    have several reasons: i) Try a different Fermi-Method (change
    TETRA to GAUSS or TEMP in <TT><B>case.in2</B></TT>). ii) Count  the number 
of eigenvalues in     <TT><B>case.output1</B></TT> and compare it
    with the number of valence electrons. If there are too few
    eigenvalues, either increase EMAX in <TT><B>case.klist</B></TT> (from 1.5 to
    e.g. 2.5) or check if your scf cycle had large charge oszillations
    (see <B>SELECT</B> error above)

<P>
</DD>
</DL>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
If the SCF cycle stops somewhere (especially in the first few
iterations), it is quite possible, that the source of the error is
actually in a previous part of the cycle or even in a previous (e.g.
the zeroth) iteration. Check in the <TT><B>case.scf</B></TT> file previous
charges, eigenvalues, ...whether they are <B>physically
  reasonable</B> (see <B>SELECT</B> error above).

1 Ghost bands
</H1>

<P>
Approximate linear dependence of the basis set or the linearization
of the energy dependence of the radial wave functions (see section
<A HREF="2Basic_concepts.html#sec:lapw">2.2</A>) can lead to spurious eigenvalues, termed ``ghost
bands''.

<P>
The first case may occur in a system which has atoms with very
different atomic sphere radii. Suppose you calculate a hydroxide with
very short O-H bonds so that you select small <IMG
 WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img311.png"
 ALT="$R_{MT}$"> radii for O and
H such as e.g. 1.0 and 0.6 a.u., respectively.  The cation may be
large and thus you could choose a large <IMG
 WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img311.png"
 ALT="$R_{MT}$"> of e.g.  2.4 a.u.
However, this gives a four time larger effective RKmax for the cation
than for H, (e.g. 16.0 when you select RKmax=4.0 in
<TT><B>case.in1</B></TT>). This enormous difference in the convergence may
lead to unphysical eigenvalues. In such cases choose lmax=12 in
<TT><B>case.in1</B></TT> (in order to get a very good re-expansion of the
plane waves) and reduce <IMG
 WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img311.png"
 ALT="$R_{MT}$"> for the cation to e.g. 1.8 a.u.

<P>
The second case can occur when you don't 
use a proper set of local orbitals. In this situation the energy 
region of interest (valence bands) falls about midway between 
two states with different principle quantum numbers, but with 
the same l-value (for one atom).

<P>
Take for example Ti with its <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img83.png"
 ALT="$3p$"> states being occupied as (semi-core) 
states, while the <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img85.png"
 ALT="$4p$"> states remain mostly unoccupied. In the 
valence band region neither of those two states (Ti <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img83.png"
 ALT="$3p$">, <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img85.png"
 ALT="$4p$">) should 
appear.  If one uses 0.2 Ry for the expansion energy E(1) for 
the <IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img312.png"
 ALT="$p$"> states of Ti, then Ti-p states do appear as ghost bands. 
Such a run is shown below for <IMG
 WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$TiO_2$"> (rutile).

<P>
The lowest six eigenvalues at GAMMA fall between about -1.30 and -1.28
Ry. They are ghost bands derived from fictitious Ti-p states. The next
four eigenvalues between -0.94 and -0.78 Ry correspond to states
derived from O 2s states, which are ok, since there are four O's per
unit cell, four states are found.

<P>
The occurrence of such unphysical (indeed, unchemical!)  ghostbands is
the first warning that something went wrong. A more definite warning
comes upon running LAPW2, where the corresponding charge densities are
calculated. If the contribution to the charge density from the energy
derivative of the basis function [the <IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img40.png"
 ALT="$B_{lm}$"> coefficient in equ.
<A HREF="2Basic_concepts.html#eq:atomic-basis">2.4</A>,<A HREF="2Basic_concepts.html#eq:LOs">2.7</A>] is significant (i.e. much more
than 5 per cent) then a warning is issued in LAPW2.

<P>
In the present example it reads:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>QTL-B VALUE .EQ.  40.35396 !!!!!!</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This message is found in both the <TT><B>case.scf</B></TT> file and in
<TT><B>case.output2</B></TT>.

<P>
When such a message appears, one can also look at the partial 
charges (QTL), which are printed under these conditions to OUTPUT2, 
and always appear in the files <TT><B>case.helpXXX</B></TT>, etc., where the last 
digit refers to the atomic index.

<P>
In the file below, note the E(1) energy parameter as well as 
the 6 ghost band energies around -1.29.

<P>
Next we show <TT><B>tio2.output2</B></TT> for the first of the ghost bands at
-1.297 Ry.  One sees that it corresponds mainly to a p-like charge,
which originates from the energy derivative part Q(UE) of the
Kohn-Sham orbital.  Q(UE) contributes 40.1% compared with 8.5% from
the main component Q(U).  Q(UE) greater than Q(U) is  a good
indication for a ghost band.

Another file in which the same information can be found is

the Ti-p energy parameter:

<P>
Note again for L=1 the percentage of charge associated with the 
primary (APW) basis functions ul (8.5%) versus that coming 
from the energy derivative component (40.1%).

<P>
If a ghost band appears, one should first analyze its origin 
as indicated above, then use appropriate local orbitals to improve 
the calculation and get rid of these unphysical states.

<P>
<B>Do not perform calculations with ``ghost-bands'', even when
  the calculation converges.</B>

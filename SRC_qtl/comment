Program QTL is designed to calculate partial densities of states projeceted
on a given basis (within orbital quantum number l subspace) in a given atomic sphere.
Similar densities of states are
calculated so far in lapw2 with option QTL. The main aim of this code is to 
calculate the destities projected on relativistic states (the use of the code 
is however more general ). The structure of the code is based on the fact that
the densities of the states can be obtained from the spectral decomposition of
the occupation number matrix (OCNM). The diagonal elements of the OCNM 
correspond to the partial densities of states projected on the basis functions.
Therefor it is possible to obtain the density of any state ( within l subspace )
once we know the spectral decomposition of OCNM by a unitary
transformation to the appropriate basis and looking at the diagonal elements.

The key part of the code is the symmetrization over the k-points, i.e. extracting information
about the whole BZ from its irreducible part. When working with relativistic states
( which are spin mixed ) the whole OCNM (i.e. also its elemnts between opposite spin functions)
must be symmetrized properly. This means that also the spinor part of the symmetry
operations must be taken into account.

There are 3 main input files to the code. 
1)case.inq (all lines are free format)
SUMA/FULL      (see below)
DOSYM/NOSYM    ( symmetrization is/is not performed )
emin, emax     (energy window)
e_fermi        (fermi energy)
ncases         (number of atoms for which the densities are calculated)
jatom  latom   (index of ineq. atom, orbital quantum number - only one per atom)

2)case.struct
The choice of the locall rotation matrix ( which can be changed after calculating 
the vectors ) defines the l,m basis of internal OCNM with respect to global coordinate system.
The spin coordinate system is set in lapwso ( is in general different from
orbital coordinate system ).

2)case.cf1,..,case.cf$ncases
The unitary transformation matrix from internal OCNM nl,m,spin basis to
the output basis (e.g. j,jz basis in the relativistic case). 
The * marks have meaning when SUMA in line 1 case.inq. They mark which diagonal
matrix elements should be summed over to obtaine e.g. total j=1/2 density instead
of the projection 1/2,-1/2 and 1/2,1/2. The latter are obtained when FULL is on.

DOSYM/NOSYM if the desities of states are calculated on the basis which is 
rotationally invariant along local axis (l,m,spin or j,jz) symmetrization
is not necessary and may be switched off to save the time.

The use of case.cf file makes the code flexible.
It assumes making a small database with case.cf files for given 
symmetry of output states. I include the the file for relativstic
(j,j_z) basis ( p,d,f states ). Here is one important note. The included
case.cf files correspond to the case when the spin and local coordinate systems
are the same ( collinear z axes are not enough ). This must be done by hand.
However, the spin coordinate matrix is at the output of the program and
this matrix should be equal to the local rotation matrix for the results to be
correct.

OUTPUT:
case.qtl1,...,case.qtl$ncases
these files are to be processed with tetra

The code can proccess paralel vector files when called as
qtl qtl.def $MAXPROC 

The part of x script to produce the def files is:
case qtl:
set exe = $command
cat << theend > $def

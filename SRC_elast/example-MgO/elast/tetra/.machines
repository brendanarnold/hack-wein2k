# .machines is the control file for parallel execution

#   weight:machine_name
#
# where weight is the relative speed of the machine
# with respect to the other machines used
# further options are:
#
#   granularity:number
#
# granularity sets the number of files that will be approximately
# be generated by each processor; this is used for load-balancing.
# On very homogeneous systems set number to 1
#
#   residue:machine_name
#
# if after distributing the k-points to the various machines residual
# k-points are left, they will be distributed to machine_name.

short description to handle OPTIC -program:

the Makefile produces an executable  optic (real version) opticc (complex)
to execute OPTIC program the definition file is needed as comand parameter.

  optic(c) optic.def

definition file:  optic.def

short comment on what is computed:

      for the linear optical response of the electronic system it is necessary to calculate
      the momentumopeerator in the one-electron picture. Compared to FERMIS GOLDEN RULE these
      matrixelements are the transitionprobability. Obviousely this should result in a hermitic
      matrix. But even the wavefunctions in LAPW are continuous in value and slope at the atomic-
      sphereboundery there are in some cases numerical significant discrepancies. So the hermicity
      can be forced by P(i,f) = (<i|P|f>+<f|P|i>* )/2. But several calculations have shown for the
      dielectric functiond there is no differenc. therefore P(i,f) = (<i|P|f>)**2 is written.
      Of course P(i,f) is only calculated in the irreducible wedge, therefore a symmetrization is 
      done treating the P(i,f,k) as a vector and applying all symmetryoperation from struct-file.
      For ORTHO=.true. structures only the 3 main components of dielectric tensor Px(i,f,k)*Px(i,f,k),
      Py(i,f,k)*Py(i,f,k) ... is written to the <case>.outmat - file. Otherwise all six compnents of 
      this symmetrix tensor are listed.
      hint: the program code is not straightforward, bacause many particularities are not smoothed yet

The update of the optic package contains changes in optic, joint, and kram:

OPTIC: 

The input file had to be changed in order to allow the calculation of specific
components. For the calculation of the imaginary part of the dielectric tensor
(in absence of spin-orbit coupling) up to 6 real components of the matrix elements
can be calculated according to the symmetry of the crystal. 

The dielectric tensor components (and other quantities) are given per spin in case of 
the spin-polarized calculation and as a sum of both spin dierection if the calculation 
is non-spinpolarized.

The programm is called as usual: x optic(c) (-up/dn)

Due to spin-orbit coupling imaginary parts of the nondiagonal elements may occur.
Thus in general, up to 9 components can be calculated at the same time. 

In order to get the correct matrix elements, the files vectorso(up/dn) have to
be used. For that purpose the following procedure is recommended:

(1) run SCF cycle: run(sp)_lapw -so
(2) generate a fine k-mesh for the optics part: x kgen
(3) change TOT to FERMI in case.in2c
(4) run lapw1, lapwso, and lapw2 with this mesh: run(sp)_lapw -so -s lapw1 -e lcore
(5) run optic: x opticc -so (-up)
(6) run joint: x joint -so (-up)
(7) run kram: x kram (-up)

Also in the spin-polarized case only one call for optic/joint/kram (either up or down) 
is necessary, since the spins are not independent any more and both vectorfiles are 
used at the same time.

JOINT:

The input of joint has been changes as well: After line four (which defines the switch)
one line has been added, where the number of columns to be taken into account is defined.
The parameter MG in param.inc defines the number of columns. Note that the program might
become big if the parameters are very large.

SWITCH 7 is new: in addition to SWITCH 6 the contributions from different bands to the
plasma frequency are analyzed.

The band analysis for all options (SWITCHES 0, 2, 5, 7) has been improved: 
For each tensor component additional files are created, where each column contains
the contributions from a single band or band combination. The file names are e.g.
case.Im_eps_xx_1, case.Im_eps_xx_2, or case.jdos_1 etc. where the number of files depend 
on the number of band /band combinations.
(WARNING: the number of band combinations might be quite big!)

KRAM:

The Kramers-Kronig analysis is carried out for the actual number of columns contained
in the case.joint(up/dn) file. For each real component its imaginary counterpart is
created and vice versa. All dielectric tensor components can be found in file 
case.epsilon(up/dn). The real and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity (in 10^15/sec)
are written to file case.sigmak(up/dn). In addition, file case.absorp containes the
real parts of the optical conductivity (in 1 / (Ohm cm)) and the absorption coefficients.

EXAMPLE:

Example inputs Al.inop, Al.injoint, Al.inkram, and Al.joint for option 4 
(dielectric tensor) are added for comparison. The calculation has been carried
out with 165 k-points in order to keep the numerical effort small. (The results
are not fully converged with respect to the number of k-points.)

The update has been done in collaboration with Jan Kunes and Pavel Novak
(Prague).  Contributions from this group are especially in the
symmetrization of the matrix elelements in presence of spin-orbit coupling.

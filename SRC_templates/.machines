# .machines is the control file for parallel execution. Add lines like
#
#   speed:machine_name
# 
# for each machine specifying there relative speed. For mpi parallelization use
#
#   speed:machine_name:1 machine_name:1
#   lapw0:machine_name:1 machine_name:1
#
# further options are:
#
#   granularity:number (for loadbalancing on irregularly used machines)
#   residue:machine_name  (on shared memory machines)
#   extrafine         (to distribute the remaining k-points one after the other)
#
# granularity sets the number of files that will be approximately
# be generated by each processor; this is used for load-balancing.
# On very homogeneous systems set number to 1
# if after distributing the k-points to the various machines residual
# k-points are left, they will be distributed to the residual-machine_name.

1:localhost
1:localhost

 ABOUT
=========

This is the source distribution of SGROUP.
The SGROUP deals with symmetry aspects of crystallography, namely for an
arbitrary choice of the unit cell the SGROUP should find a proper unit cell
and identify the space group.
All the 230 space groups were taken from the INTERNATIONAL TABLES FOR
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, 1992.

 DESCRIPTION
=============
     sgroup [options] input_file [output_file]

  OPTIONS:
   -noeq  Output contains only atoms not connected by lattice translations,
          i.e. only atoms of a primitive cell. For example, in the case
          of pure fcc lattice only (0,0,0) position will be printed,
          but not the positions (0.5, 0.5, 0.0), (0.5, 0.0, 0.5),
          (0.0, 0.5, 0.5).

   -prim  Use the basis of the primitive cell for output.

   -wi   -wien-input
          Read data from a file written to be input for the WIEN package.
          That's WIEN's case.struct file. The output file contains lattice
          parameters and atomic positions required by WIEN package.
          Also a symmetry check of the input file is produced.

   -wo   -wien-output
          Generate WIEN's struct file. To do this -wi option has to be given.

   -set-TOL=number
          Set tolerance for floating arithmetic to a value specified 
          by `number`. Spaces not allowed between `number` and `=` character.
          Typical values for `number` are 0.0001, 0.00001.

   -help  Print this message and exit.

 NOTES
========= 


1. For all cubic, tetragonal and orthorombic groups, if any,
   only the "origin choice 2" is implemented (inversion at the origin).


2. For monoclinic lattice only "unique axis c" and "cell choice 1"
   are implemented.


3. To make input more convenient various choices of centring modes
   for lattices have been introduced (Table below). 
   It supposes that only atoms of primitive cell and parameters of the 
   conventional cell (see below) must be given.
   The atom positions must be given with respect to the basis of the
   conventional cell.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Possible centring modes are:
     P - primitive
     F - all face centred
     I - body centred
     C - one face centred
     A - one face centred

4. Output is restricted to the following lattice types:
   primitive    - cubic, tetragonal, orthorombic, monoclinic, triclinic
   F  centred   - cubic, orthorombic
   I  centred   - cubic, tetragonal, orthorombic
   rhombohedral - default output supposes the hexagonal obverse setting,
                  the -prim option will change output to the rhombohedral basis.
   hexagonal    - hexagonal and trigonal
   C  centred   - orthorombic
   A  centred   - orthorombic, monoclinic


5. Internal program parameters are stored in the file type_sg.h 
       MAX_ATOMS=4096  -  maximal number of atoms
       MAX_CHARS=32    -  maximal number of characters in atom name
       TOL=1.e-4       -  tolerance for floating arithmetic


6. Example of the input file:
Real structures are collected in ./examples directory.
Below just a skeleton.

  BUGS
========

 1) Usually more than one choice exists to set up
    crystallography cell which is consistent to given space group orientation.
    Thus, output is not unique.

 There are minor problems:

 2) In the program all floating comparisons are controlled 
    by the parameter TOL.
    So, program will not work correctly if input data reside near 
    this threshold.

 3) Incorrect input may produce the "Segmentation fault" message.

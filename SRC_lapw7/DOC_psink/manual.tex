The program {\tt lapw7} generates wave function data on spatial grids
for a given set of $k$-points and electronic bands. 
{\tt lapw7} uses the wave function information stored in {\tt case.vector} 
(or in reduced (filtered) form in {\tt case.vectorf} which can be obtained
from {\tt case.vector} by running the program {\tt filtvec}).
Depending on the options set in the input file {\tt case.in7(c)} one can
generate the real or imaginary part of the wave functions, it's modulus
(absolute value) or argument, or the complex wave function itself. 
For scalar-relativistic calculations both the large and the small 
component of the wave functions can be generated (only one at a time).
The wave functions are generated on a grid which is to be specified in
the input file(s). The grid can either be any arbitrary list of points
(to be specified free-formatted in a separate file {\tt case.grid}) 
or any $n$-dimensional grid ($n=0...3$). The operating mode and 
grid parameters are specified in the input file {\tt case.in7(c)}.
As output {\tt lapw7} writes the specified wave function data for further
processing -- e.g. for plotting the wave functions with some graphical tools
such as gnuplot -- in raw format to {\tt case.psink}. For quick inspection,
a subset of this data is echoed to the standard output file
{\tt case.outputf} (the amount of data can be controlled in the input).
In case, {\tt lapw7} is called many times for one and the same wave function,
program overhead can be reduced, by first storing the atomic augmentation
coefficients $A_{lm}$, $B_{lm}$ (and $C_{lm}$) to a binary file {\tt case.abc}.
For the spin-polarized case two different calculations have to be performed
using either the spin-up or the spin-down wave function data as input.
 
It should be easy to run {\tt lapw7} in parallel mode, and/or to apply it to
wave function data obtained by a spin-orbit interaction calculation.
None of these options have been implemented so far.
Also, {\tt lapw7} has not yet been adapted for {\bf WIEN in a BOX}.


\subsubsection{Execution}

The program {\tt lapw7} is executed by invoking the command:

\vspace*{.25cm}
\hspace*{1.cm}
{\tt lapw7 lapw7.def}\ \ \ or\ \ \ {\tt lapw7c lapw7.def}\ \ \ or\ \ \ 
{\tt x lapw7 [-c] [-up|dn] [-sel]}

\vspace*{.25cm}
With the {\tt -sel} option {\tt lapw7} expects data from the reduced (filtered) 
wave function file {\tt case.vectorf}, otherwise the standard wave function file
{\tt case.vector} is used. The reduced vector file {\tt case.vectorf} is
assumed to resist in the current working directory, while the standard 
vector file {\tt case.vector} (which may become quite large) is looked for in
the {\tt WIEN} scratch directory. For details see {\tt lapw7.def}.

An example of {\tt lapw7.def} is given below.

\subsubsection{Dimensioning parameters}

The following parameters are listed in file {\tt param.inc\_(r/c)}:

\vspace*{.25cm}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
NATO  & & number of inequivalent atoms per unit cell \\[-.0ex]
NDIF  & & total number of atoms per unit cell \\[-.0ex]
NRAD  & & number of radial mesh points \\[-.0ex]
NSYM  & & order of point group \\[-.0ex]
NGDIM & & overall number of grid points \\[-.0ex]
NMAT  & & total number of basis functions (matrix size) \\[-.0ex]
NRMT  & & number of different muffin-tin radii \\ [-.0ex]
LMAX7 & & maximum L value used for plane wave augmentation \\[-.0ex]
LOMAX & & maximum L value used for local orbitals \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace*{.25cm}

The meaning of {\tt LMAX7} is the same as that of {\tt LMAX2} in 
{\tt lapw2} and that of {\tt LMAX-1} in {\tt lapw1}. Rather than being 
an upper bound it directly defines the number of augmentation functions 
to be used. It many be set different to {\tt LMAX2} in {\tt lapw2} or 
{\tt LMAX-1} in {\tt lapw1}, but it must not exceed the latter one.
Note that, the degree of continuity of the wave functions across the boundary
of the muffin tin sphere is quite sensitive to the choice of the parameter 
{\tt LMAX7}. A value of 8 for {\tt LMAX7} turned out to be a good compromise.


\subsubsection{Input}

A sample input is given below. It shows how to plot a set of wave 
functions on a 2-dim.\ grid.

The program {\tt filtvec} reduces the information stored in 
{\tt case.vector} files by filtering out a user-specified selection of 
wave functions. Either a fixed set of band indices can be selected which is 
used for all selected $k$-points (global selection mode), or the band
indices can be selected individually for each selected $k$-point
(individual selection mode).
The complete wave function and band structure information for the 
selected $k$-points and bands is transferred to {\tt case.vectorf}.
The information on all other wave functions in the original file is 
discarded. The structure of the generated {\tt case.vectorf} file is 
identical to that of the original {\tt case.vector} file. Hence, it should 
be possible to use {\tt case.vectorf} as substitutes for {\tt case.vector} 
anywhere in the {\bf WIEN} program package. (This has only been tested for 
{\tt lapw7}.and {\tt filtvec}.)
To filter vector files from spin-polarized calculations, {\tt filtvec}
has to be run separately for both the spin-up and the spin-down files.

{\tt filtvec} has not yet been adapted for {\bf WIEN in a BOX}.


\subsubsection{Execution}

The program {\tt filtvec} is executed by invoking the command:

\vspace*{.25cm}
\hspace*{1.cm}
{\tt filtvec filtvec.def}\ \ \ or\ \ \ {\tt filtvecc filtvec.def}\ \ \ or\ \ \ 
{\tt x filtvec [-c] [-up|dn]}

\vspace*{.25cm}
In accordance with the file handling for {\tt lapw1} and {\tt lapw7} the input 
vector file {\tt case.vector} is assumed to be located in the {\tt WIEN}
scratch directory, while the reduced output vector file {\tt case.vectorf} is
written to the current working directory. See {\tt filtvec.def} for details.

\vspace*{0.25cm}
An example of {\tt filtvec.def} is given below.

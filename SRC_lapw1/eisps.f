      double precision function epslon (x)

      double precision x

      double precision a,b,c,eps
!
!     this program should function properly on all systems
!     satisfying the following two assumptions,
!        1.  the base used in representing floating point
!            numbers is not a power of three.
!        2.  the quantity  a  in statement 10 is represented to
!            the accuracy used in floating point variables
!            that are stored in memory.
!     the statement number 10 and the go to 10 are intended to
!     force optimizing compilers to generate code satisfying
!     assumption 2.
!     under these assumptions, it should be true that,
!            a  is not exactly equal to four-thirds,
!            b  has a zero for its last bit or digit,
!            c  is not exactly equal to one,
!            eps  measures the separation of 1.0 from
!                 the next larger floating point number.
!     the developers of eispack would appreciate being informed
!     about any systems where these assumptions do not hold.
